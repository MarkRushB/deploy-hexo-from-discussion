#### üìù How the Workflow Processes Discussions

When a new discussion is created, the workflow extracts and formats the following information:

- **Title** (`.title`) ‚Üí Used as the blog post title.
- **Created Date** (`.created_at`) ‚Üí Formatted as `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`.
- **Body** (`.body`) ‚Üí The main content of the discussion.
- **Labels** (`.labels[].name`) ‚Üí Used for custom layouts and icons.

The discussion is then converted into a **Markdown file** in the `source/_posts/` directory of the Hexo repository.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Disclaimer**Ôºö This GitHub Actions workflow is **designed for my specific Hexo template**. Some label-based conversions are customized for my Hexo **Front-matter format**, and they may not be compatible with other Hexo themes or templates.

### What You Need to Modify:
- **Label-to-Front-matter conversion**: The `layout` and `icon` fields are assigned based on discussion labels (`memo`, `bullshit`, etc.). If your Hexo template does not use these fields, you should **update the logic** in `.github/workflows/sync-discussions.yml`.
- **Markdown File Structure**: The generated posts follow my template's format. If your template uses different Front-matter keys or additional metadata fields, adjust the workflow accordingly.

##### üìå Example Output:

If a discussion titled **"My Thoughts on Open Source"** is created with the **`memo`** label, the resulting Markdown file (`source/_posts/My Thoughts on Open Source.md`) will look like:

```markdown
---
title: "My Thoughts on Open Source"
date: 2024-11-15 14:30:00
layout: tweet
icon: sad
---
This is the body content of the discussion...
```
